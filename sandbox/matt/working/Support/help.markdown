# Introduction

A word about development and a call for assistance.

# Tab Triggers

Tab triggers exist for every built-in FileMaker function with the trigger being the function name. For those functions that take parameters, a template is included as part of the trigger. Additionally, most built-in FileMaker functions have unique abbreviated tab triggers. To discover the abbreviated tab trigger, find the function in the FileMaker bundle menu (Bundles>FileMaker>[Function Category]>[Function Name]).
